# Udacity First Project - Exploration of Seattle vs Boston Airbnb Data
## Project Description
The project tries to delve deep into Seattle and Boston AirBnb Data and try to answer three questions:
1. **What are the most important amenities for a house, and which neighbourhood supplies which amenities for accommodation? And then compare them between Boston and Seattle.**
2. **How does the price change with each month and what is the number of listings for each month?**
3. **Can we predict price with some of the basic features?**
## Python Package Requirements
Python3.6 has been used and package requirements for this project are:
* numpy
* pandas
* matplotlib
* seaborn
* plotly
* scikit-learn
